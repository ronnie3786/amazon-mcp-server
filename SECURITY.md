# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security considerations, threat model, and best practices for the Amazon Cart MCP Server. This project is designed for **personal, single-user use** and is NOT suitable for production multi-tenant deployments without significant security enhancements.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Architecture

### Current Security Model

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Threat Model: Personal Use Only                        │
│                                                         │
│ Trusted: Your local machine, your Amazon account       │
│ Untrusted: Network, optional tunnels, external clients │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Security Assessment

### ✅ Implemented Security Controls

1. **Authentication**
   - Bearer token authentication for MCP requests
   - Configurable AUTH_TOKEN via environment variables
   - MCP requests require a valid token unless `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=true`

2. **Transport Security**
   - CLI commands do not start a network server
   - MCP server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default
   - Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint for local clients

3. **Data Protection**
   - Session data isolated in `./user-data/` directory
   - Credentials never logged or transmitted
   - `.gitignore` prevents accidental commits of sensitive data

4. **Input Validation**
   - Type checking via TypeScript
   - JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol validation
   - Parameter validation for tool calls

### ⚠️ Security Limitations

1. **Single-User Architecture**
   - No user management or multi-tenancy
   - Single AUTH_TOKEN for all access
   - No session management or token rotation

2. **Browser Security**
   - Puppeteer runs with `--no-sandbox` (required for some systems)
   - Persistent browser session stores sensitive cookies
   - No automatic session expiration

3. **Logging**
   - Verbose logging may expose request/response data
   - No audit trail for compliance
   - Console logs not encrypted at rest

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - No rate limiting implemented
   - Could be abused if AUTH_TOKEN is compromised
   - Amazon may rate-limit or block automated requests

5. **Secrets Management**
   - Secrets stored in plaintext `.env` file
   - No encryption at rest for configuration
   - No secrets rotation mechanism

## Threat Model

### In-Scope Threats

| Threat | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|------------|------------|
| AUTH_TOKEN exposure | High | Medium | Use strong token, do not expose MCP publicly |
| Session hijacking | High | Low | Prefer CLI or localhost-bound MCP |
| Credential theft | High | Low | User-data directory in .gitignore |
| Man-in-the-middle | Medium | Low | Avoid remote tunnels; add HTTPS/auth if tunneling |
| Denial of service | Low | Medium | Personal use only, restart if needed |

### Out-of-Scope Threats

- Multi-tenant attacks (not designed for multi-user)
- SOC 2 / HIPAA compliance (not applicable)
- DDoS at scale
- Advanced persistent threats (personal use case)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### 🔴 Critical

1. **Generate Strong AUTH_TOKEN**
   ```bash
   # Use cryptographically secure random token
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```

2. **Never Commit Secrets**
   - Never commit `.env` file
   - Never commit `user-data/` directory
   - Verify `.gitignore` is in place

3. **Protect Tunnel URLs**
   - Do not share public tunnel URLs
   - Add tunnel-level authentication if you expose MCP remotely
   - Rotate URLs and tokens if compromised

#### 🟡 Important

4. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   ```

5. **Monitor Access**
   - Review server logs regularly
   - Watch for unexpected requests
   - Note any failed authentication attempts

6. **Use HEADLESS Mode**
   - Set `HEADLESS=true` after initial login
   - Reduces attack surface
   - Prevents accidental exposure

#### 🟢 Recommended

7. **Regular Token Rotation**
   - Rotate AUTH_TOKEN monthly
   - Update in both `.env` and your MCP client

8. **Secure Your Machine**
   - Use full disk encryption
   - Enable firewall
   - Keep OS updated

9. **Limit Network Exposure**
   - Prefer the CLI for personal use
   - Keep MCP bound to `127.0.0.1`
   - If tunneling, add tunnel-level auth and IP restrictions
   - Do not run exposed services on public WiFi without VPN

## Vulnerability Disclosure

## Known Security Issues

### Current Limitations

1. **No Rate Limiting**
   - **Impact**: Could be abused if token leaked
   - **Mitigation**: Use strong token, monitor logs
   - **Status**: By design (personal use)

2. **Plaintext Secrets Storage**
   - **Impact**: `.env` file contains sensitive data
   - **Mitigation**: File system permissions, .gitignore
   - **Status**: Acceptable for personal use

3. **No Session Expiration**
   - **Impact**: Amazon session persists indefinitely
   - **Mitigation**: Manual logout, periodic re-login
   - **Status**: By design (convenience)

4. **Verbose Logging**
   - **Impact**: Logs may contain request data
   - **Mitigation**: Secure log storage, periodic cleanup
   - **Status**: Acceptable for debugging

   - Use environment-specific secrets

3. **Audit Logging**
   - Log all authentication attempts
   - Log all tool invocations
   - Include timestamps, user IDs, IP addresses
   - Store logs securely with retention policies
   - Implement log monitoring and alerting

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement per-user rate limits

   - Consider tool-specific limits

5. **Data Encryption**
   - Encrypt session data at rest
   - Use secure key management
   - Consider field-level encryption

## Code Security Review

### Findings

#### ✅ Good Practices

- TypeScript for type safety
- Input validation via JSON-RPC schema
- .gitignore properly configured
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- CORS enabled but authentication required
- Localhost-only binding

#### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

1. **Browser Sandbox Disabled**
   - Location: `src/browser.ts:188`
   - Risk: Reduced isolation for browser processes
   - Mitigation: Required for compatibility, acceptable for personal use

2. **Error Messages May Leak Information**
   - Location: Multiple error handlers
   - Risk: Stack traces could reveal internal structure
   - Mitigation: Sanitize error messages in production

3. **No Input Sanitization for Amazon Queries**
   - Location: `src/amazon.ts` - search and cart functions
   - Risk: Unusual inputs could cause unexpected behavior
   - Mitigation: Add input length limits and character validation

4. **Session Data Not Encrypted**
   - Location: `user-data/` directory
   - Risk: File system access = full session access
   - Mitigation: OS-level encryption, secure file permissions

## Dependency Security

### Current Status

Run regular security audits:

```bash
npm audit
```

### Known Dependencies

- `puppeteer` - Browser automation (maintained by Chrome team)
- `express` - Web framework (well-maintained)
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` - MCP implementation
- `dotenv` - Environment configuration

### Recommendations

1. Enable GitHub Dependabot alerts
2. Run `npm audit` before each release
3. Keep all dependencies up to date
4. Review security advisories for critical dependencies

## Incident Response

### If AUTH_TOKEN is Compromised

1. **Immediately** stop the server
2. Generate new AUTH_TOKEN: `openssl rand -hex 32`
3. Update `.env` with new token
4. Update token in your MCP client
5. Restart server with new token
6. Review logs for unauthorized access
7. Consider rotating Amazon password if suspicious activity detected

### If Session Data is Compromised

1. Delete `./user-data/` directory
2. Log out of Amazon on all devices
3. Change Amazon password
4. Enable Amazon 2FA if not already enabled
5. Restart server and log in fresh

### If a Tunnel URL is Exposed

1. Stop the tunnel
2. Rotate `AUTH_TOKEN`
3. Start a new tunnel URL if still needed
4. Add tunnel-level authentication or IP restrictions before reconnecting
